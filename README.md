# practice-fixing-merge-conflicts
This repo is for practice fixing git merge conflicts

Instructions:

1) clone directly from this repo. (you don't need to fork your own version).
2) branch off of main (git checkout -b new-branch)
3) make changes (add an extra line somewhere in the code, or add more).
4) commit code (git add . then git commit -m "...")
5) push your commits to remote repo (do not merge your local branch into your local main) (git push ...)
6) create a pull request (done using github website)
7) merge local branch to remote main (done using the github website)
8) repeat:
    git checkout main
    git pull origin main
    git checkout -b another-new-branch

Don't worry about messing the code up. It is all sample code. The important thing is to learn how to deal with merges.
