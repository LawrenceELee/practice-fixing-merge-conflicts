# practice-fixing-merge-conflicts
This repo is for practice fixing git merge conflicts

Instructions:

1) clone directly from this repo. (you don't need to fork your own version).
2) branch off of main.
3) make changes (add an extra line somewhere in the code, or add more).
4) commit code
5) push your commits to repo
6) create a pull request
7) merge code to main
8) fix any problems

Don't worry about messing the code up. It is all sample code. The important thing is to learn how to deal with merges.
